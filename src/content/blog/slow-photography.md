We live in an age of abundance. Digital cameras can capture thousands of images on a single card. Phone storage is measured in hundreds of gigabytes. The cost of taking another photo is essentially zero.

But what have we lost in this abundance?

## The Film Photographer's Mindset

When I first picked up my father's old Pentax K1000, each roll of film gave me 36 exposures. That's it. Factor in the cost of the film and development, and suddenly every click of the shutter carried weight.

This limitation forced me to slow down. To think before shooting. To really *see* what was in front of me before committing it to film.

## Why Constraints Matter

Creative constraints aren't obstacles—they're frameworks that force us to think more carefully about our choices. When you have unlimited shots, it's tempting to spray and pray. When you have 36, you compose with intention.

Some ways to practice slow photography:

- **Leave your camera at home** occasionally. Just observe. Notice light, composition, moments.
- **Set artificial limits**. Try shooting an entire day with just 10 frames.
- **Review before you shoot**. Ask yourself: "Why this frame? What story does it tell?"

## The Edit as Part of the Process

Slow photography doesn't end when you release the shutter. It continues through curation. A tight edit of 5 stunning images beats a gallery of 500 mediocre ones.

Spend time with your photos. Let them breathe. Return to them days or weeks later with fresh eyes. You'll find that distance reveals which images truly resonate.

## Finding Balance

I'm not suggesting we abandon digital photography—its advantages are too significant to ignore. But we can bring the intentionality of film to our digital practice.

Next time you head out with your camera, try this: shoot as if every frame costs $1. You'll be surprised at how it changes your approach, and how much stronger your work becomes.
