As another year draws to a close, I find myself looking back at the thousands of frames captured, the stories told, and the lessons learned. 2025 was a year of growth, experimentation, and occasional failure—which, as any creative knows, is often where the best lessons hide.

## The Highlights

This year took me to places I'd only dreamed of photographing. A month in Japan during cherry blossom season. The rugged coastlines of Portugal. The quiet stillness of the Scottish Highlands in winter.

But some of my favorite images came from much closer to home. A morning walk through the neighborhood. Light streaming through my kitchen window. My daughter's first steps.

## What I Learned

### 1. Gear Matters Less Than I Thought

I spent the first half of the year convinced I needed better equipment. A new lens. A faster body. More megapixels. Then I spent a week shooting exclusively with my phone, and the results surprised me.

The camera is just a tool. Vision is what matters.

### 2. Consistency Beats Inspiration

Waiting for inspiration is a trap. The best work came from showing up every day, regardless of motivation. Some days produced nothing worthwhile. Others yielded images I'll treasure forever. But they all contributed to growth.

### 3. Community is Essential

Photography can be solitary, but it shouldn't be isolated. This year I joined a local photography group, participated in online critiques, and reached out to photographers I admire. Every conversation made me better.

## Looking Ahead

For 2026, I'm setting intentions rather than goals:

- **Shoot more film**. The deliberate pace suits how I want to work.
- **Print more**. Images deserve to exist beyond screens.
- **Collaborate**. I want to work with other creatives—models, stylists, other photographers.
- **Teach**. Sharing knowledge reinforces understanding.

Thank you to everyone who followed along this year. Your support, comments, and shares mean more than you know. Here's to another year of chasing light and telling stories.
